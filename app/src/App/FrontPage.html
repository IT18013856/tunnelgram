    {brand} servers never know your password or your private encryption key, so
    everything you send over {brand} is 100% secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your encryption is only as strong as your password, so choose a good
    password to keep perfectly secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because {brand} doesn't know your password, and can't access your messages,
    if you lose your password, your messages are gone forever. Seriously, this
    is how secure it is. Without your password, your messages are
    <strong>unreadable</strong>!
