      {brand} encrypts every message, photo, and video you send with a special
      key that only the recipients can access. And unlike other encrypted
      messengers, you can log in and keep chatting on all your devices at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      The servers never know your password or your private encryption key, so
      everything you send is
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin/tunnelgram/blob/master/README.md#the-tunnelwire-encryption-scheme" target="_blank">100% secure</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Your encryption is only as strong as your password, so choose a good one.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      If you lose your password, your messages are gone forever. Seriously, this
      is how secure it is. Without your password, your messages are
      <strong>unreadable</strong>!
